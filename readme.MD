# Color Flipper
## Functionality
This is fun little project that lets change colors with the click of the button.

You can have a simple mode where you choose from built in colors or hex, where color is randomly generated when button is clicked.

Simple mode displays color name or code, hex display randomly generated color code and paints background with it.

I used getElementById method in order to manipulate button and querySelector to change the background color.

I also used Math.random to generate random color:

I created an array with all possible chars in hexadecimal color ( 0-9, A-F) and used Math.random to select piece from array

and add it to the color number. I used for loop for this task.
